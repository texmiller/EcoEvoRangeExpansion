# EcoEvoRangeExpansion
Meta-analysis of studies that contrast range expansion with and without eco-evolultionary feedbacks
\\
This repo includes three files needed to reproduce the meta-analysis presented in Miller et al. 2020 ("Eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion"), Figure 3.
### 1 - spread_data.csv includes raw data extracted from the original studies
### 2 - spread_functions.R is a source file that includes custom functions for meta-analysis
### 3 - spread_models.R conducts the meta-analysis following methods from Nakagawa et al. (2015) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 6, 143-152
